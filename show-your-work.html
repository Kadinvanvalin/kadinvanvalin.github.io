No. More than that. There are messy and I don't have a goal for any of it. I fill my todo app with ideas, names of new people I meet and projects that I think would be fun to execute on. I write in notebooks, on printer paper and eventually a lot ends up in a giant markdown document. The notes are incomplete and often I lose enough context that they have no value after a week or two.<br><br>In L.A. last week I was introduced to a new book. Show your work by Austin Kleon. I have often come across the idea that it is essential to have an online presence, and a blog is needed to grow a software career, but that isn't something that I find very compelling.<br>I hate talking about myself, and if I wanted to go into sales I would have. No, I may try in fits and starts, but marketing yourself for the purpose of marketing yourself doesn't resonate with me. Show your work makes a slightly different argument. As a follow-up to Steal like an artist, Austin argues that having an online presence is about allowing others to steal from you. <br><br>Furthermore, I like the idea of creating a space to steal from myself. Instead of the rushed scribbling that can lead to forgetting the original intent, something published should (hopefully) have a little more context, be more formal and make more sense in a year from now when I am reviewing what I have worked on.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 19, 2026</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://kadin.codes/league-of-legends-creep-score.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  League of Legends &quot;creep&quot; score "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">League of Legends &quot;creep&quot; score</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://kadin.codes/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c2232aa7558e9517946129d2a1b8c770"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
