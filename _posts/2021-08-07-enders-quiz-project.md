Enders game is a 1985 Science fiction novel written by Orson Scott card. 
In 2007 I had just finished a skills course by [thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com). I was starting to look for employment was was unsure if I had the skills needed to be marketable.

Considering how rough this project is, I think it makes sense that it took me another year to land my first job.
