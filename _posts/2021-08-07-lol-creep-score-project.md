[Creep Score](/Lol-api/)
![Image of a poorly made dashboard](/assets/lol-creep-score.png)
League of Legends is an online tower defense game. A core compenent of the game is landing the killing blow on minions that defend the towers. The count of this is normally called creep score, or cs.
In 2006 I signed up for a skills course by [thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com) to learn html, javascript and css. The capstone project was to create a site that integrated with an API. The site is broken now because league of legends api has changed. I added a demo button to make it easier to see how the site functioned in 2006.
