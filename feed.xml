                <p><br>I take a lot of notes. No. More than that. There are messy and I don't have a goal for any of it. I fill my todo app with ideas, names of new people I meet and projects that I think would be fun to execute on. I write in notebooks, on printer paper and eventually a lot ends up in a giant markdown document. The notes are incomplete and often I lose enough context that they have no value after a week or two.<br><br>In L.A. last week I was introduced to a new book. Show your work by Austin Kleon. I have often come across the idea that it is essential to have an online presence, and a blog is needed to grow a software career, but that isn't something that I find very compelling.<br>I hate talking about myself, and if I wanted to go into sales I would have. No, I may try in fits and starts, but marketing yourself for the purpose of marketing yourself doesn't resonate with me. Show your work makes a slightly different argument. As a follow-up to Steal like an artist, Austin argues that having an online presence is about allowing others to steal from you. <br><br>Furthermore, I like the idea of creating a space to steal from myself. Instead of the rushed scribbling that can lead to forgetting the original intent, something published should (hopefully) have a little more context, be more formal and make more sense in a year from now when I am reviewing what I have worked on.</p>

The count of this is normally called creep score, or cs.<br>In 2006 I signed up for a skills course by [thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com) to learn html, javascript and css. The capstone project was to create a site that integrated with an API. The site is broken now because league of legends api has changed. I added a demo button to make it easier to see how the site functioned in 2006.</p>
